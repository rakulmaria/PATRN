A canvas-based perler bead pattern designer built for iPad. Pick a color, paint cells, build a pattern — then use it as a reference while placing real beads on a pegboard.

Think MS Paint meets a bead pegboard.

## Features

- **29×29 grid** rendered on a single HTML Canvas — retina-sharp on all displays
- **33 Hama bead colors** in a horizontally scrollable palette
- **Paint & erase** — tap or drag to fill cells; full erase tool
- **Undo / redo** — entire drag strokes are one undo step (Cmd/Ctrl+Z / Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- **Pencil-only mode** — blocks finger/palm input, lets you draw with Apple Pencil while your hand rests on the screen
- **Axis labels** — numbered rows and columns so counting beads is easy
- **Export as PNG** — white background composite, retina resolution
- **Persistent** — grid, active color, and settings survive page reloads via localStorage

## Architecture notes

**Grid state** is a flat `string[]` of length `rows × cols`, indexed as `row * cols + col`. Empty cell = `""`. This lives in Zustand and is the single source of truth — the canvas is just a view over it.

**Undo/redo** uses a snapshot stack. `beginStroke()` is called once on pointer-down and snapshots the current grid. `paintCell` and `eraseCell` modify the grid freely without touching history, so an entire drag stroke is one undo step. Max 100 steps.

**Input** is handled entirely via the Pointer Events API. `touch-action: none` on the canvas tells the browser not to scroll on touch, removing the need for `{ passive: false }` event listeners. `setPointerCapture` keeps events firing even when the pointer drifts outside the canvas.

**Pencil-only mode** filters on `e.pointerType === 'touch'` — blocking fingers and palms while passing through `'pen'` (Apple Pencil) and `'mouse'` (desktop).
